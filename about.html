				<h3> Note to future self  </h3>
				<p class="salutation">Dear Olufemi,</p>
				<p>
					I hope you're proud of how far you've come, even if it doesn&apos;t always feel like progress. 
					I know there were days when doubt felt heavier than clarity, but you kept showing up. 
					You kept learning, creating, and trying, not because you always felt ready, but because you cared.
					Please don&apos;t forget that growth isn&apos;t loud or dramatic most of the time. It&apos;s in the quiet 
					moments where you choose to keep going, even when no one&apos;s watching. Be kind to yourself, even now. 
					You&apos;re not behind. You&apos;re just becoming.
				</p>

			<section data-testid="test-about-extra">
				<h3> Extra thoughts  </h3>
				<p>
					If you ever find yourself feeling stuck, uncertain, or disconnected from your purpose, pause for a moment 
					and breathe. Remember why you started. Not everything needs to be figured out at once. Sometimes the most 
					important thing is simply to stay open â€” to learning, to change, to stillness. You don&apos;t have to chase everything. 
					Some things will find you when you&apos;re ready. Trust that.
